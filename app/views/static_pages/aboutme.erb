    Hi, my name is Kavin Srithongkham. As a Computer Science undergrad at the University of California,
    San Diego, I often find myself quickly learning new skills and concepts everyday. When I'm not holed up
    coding for assignments or studying for tests, you can find me wandering the virtual worlds of video games.
    Sometimes I even take the adventure out of the virtual world and dabble in Dungeons & Dragons with a
    couple of friends on a late, pizza-filled night. Luckily for me, my sense of curiosity and adventure has
    carried over to my passion for computer science and hopefully my journey can have a chapter at your company.
